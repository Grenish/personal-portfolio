# Hi there, I'm Grenish Rai ðŸ‘‹
I am a web developer specializing in front-end development and UI/UX design. My passion lies in technology and open source initiatives. Currently, I am studying for my BCA at SMIT in Majitar.

When I have free time, I enjoy reading, playing guitar and piano, and listening to music. Ed Sheeran is a favorite musician of mine, and I am also a fan of anime, particularly Naruto and One Piece.

This portfolio website is made using React, Tailwindcss, and MaterialUI and is hosted on vercel.
